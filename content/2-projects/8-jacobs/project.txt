I was the first communications designer at the Jacobs School for Design Innovation which was just established and built in 2015. We were in startup mode and I was in charge of designing for print and web. We wanted to balance Jacobs design standards but at the same time blend new flavors in which each graphic piece. Here you can see iterations of various pieces I designed over the year.

#Jacobs Design Conversations 
I designed a flyer and web banners.
