In preparation for my co-ed entrepreneurship fraternity's Fall 2016 rush, I worked alongside my friend <a href="http://hongyexu.co">Hongye Xu</a> to develop a theme. In previous years our branding and visuals were described as "friendly" and "open" but this year's theme took a slight turn. Through numerous concept explorations, iterations, and surveys, we came up with Diverge. Why Diverge? At a high-level, we felt that previous years' themes were too similar and in that sense didn't reflect the nature of entrepreneurship. As entrepreneurs, we always strive to be unique individuals and are not afraid of diverging from the typical path.
