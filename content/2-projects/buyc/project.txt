During the YC Hackathon, I worked with a few friends to solve a problem: How might we connect small business owners to impulse shoppers instantly? Groupon would be the first go at solving this problem--provide a mobile app to display deals and coupons. However, services that publicize their deals on Groupon take far longer than a day to realize their results. The solution we came up with was to build a web application for these businesses to push their own information to the database--those deals would then be displayed on a separate phone app.

My specific role for this hack was to design the mobile application.

	</li>
</ul>

**Design Goals**

Some design goals we had in mind were: incentivizing users to claim a deal to make impulse decisions by designating a fast expiry time, designing a flow for users to **quickly** understand the context around the deal, and claiming it.

**Inspiration**

<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-4" data-clearing>

	<li>

	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
  		(image: Groupon.png)
	</li>
	<li>
  		(image: Yelp.png)
	</li>

</ul>

We took inspiration from various mobile apps, some of which are Airbnb, Groupon, and Yelp. We liked how Airbnb displays the text belonging to a post underneath the picture to avoid clutter and also to avoid blocking the image--high-res images are crucial to Airbnb's goal of emphasizing discovery. 

**Flows**

The basic flow we came up with is the following: The user clicks on a deal, understands the context around that deal, claims the deal by asking for the generated code from our web app, and racks up points that can then be used for prizes, raffles, etc.
