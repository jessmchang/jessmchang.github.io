This is my mobile app design for Yelp Recipes, which is a conceptual product where users are able to open up a recipe page, share it, and follow directions for creating it.

</ul>

	</li>
        <li>
                 (image: recipe-ingredients.png)
       </li>
</ul>

I considered a few use cases:

* A curious foodie, Karen, who likes to quickly browse through different recipes, look for an appealing one, and quickly get the details of a recipe
* Another foodie, Jasmine, likes to share recipes frequently.
* Nicole uses the recipes page for its original purpose: making sure she has all the necessary ingredients and following the instructions on the recipe.

Considering the use cases, some goals I had in mind while designing the recipe page were to create a recipe detail view that optimizes for sharing, as well as allow users to easily access each recipe element.

#Page structure?

Idea 1: Displaying all information on one page VS Idea 2: separate sections for ingredients and instructions

<ul class="small-block-grid-2" data-clearing>
<li>(image: sketches-structure1.jpg)</li>
<li>(image: sketches-structure2.jpg)</li>
</ul>

Idea 1 - display all at once
Pros: Conventional way of displaying information
Cons: doesn’t do a great job of allowing a user to access the ingredients and instructions easily. A user such as Karen, who wants to see the ingredients and instructions quickly would  find it annoying that she has to constantly scroll down and  find the ingredients/instructions sections.

Idea 2 - separate sections
Pros: Allows user to easily access ingredients/instructions. More scalable for new features —if in the future the design team decides to add functionality (i.e.link ingredients to amazon)
Cons: Other pages may not be as noticeable

#Showing more information?

Modals vs Expansions

* I designed the description section to expand if a user presses “Read more”. There would be a limit to the length of the description since recipe descriptions are quite short.
* I designed the user reviews to open up in a new page if a user presses the “View all” button. Expansions wouldn’t intuitively work in this situation since for most recipes there are more than just a few user reviews.

#Optimize for sharing

Since Yelp is a largely social app, I wanted to optimize the recipe page for sharing. My intention is that in the future, users would be able to develop a recipe sharing community.

A few ideas I had were to have a giant “Share” button above the recipe title, have a text  field with a share button placed next to it under the recipe image. However both of these ideas would annoy the user, and take up too much real estate. As a solution, I designed a footer with action items related to sharing the recipe (send to someone, share recipe publicly, bookmarking the recipe). By attaching the footer to the recipe header, the user associates the recipe object as being innately shareable.

#Ingredients section

<ul class="small-block-grid-2" data-clearing>
<li>(image: sketches-ingredients.jpg)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

There are a few cases for why a user might visit the ingredients section: the user is preparing to make the meal, or the user just wants to quickly understand what is required of the recipe. As such, I designed the page to include details for what a user might expect to see when beginning to follow the recipe: time it takes to prepare the food, # servings, and calories.

#How-to section

<ul class="small-block-grid-2" data-clearing>
<li>(image: sketches-howto.jpg)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

Similarly, I designed the how-to section to include the preparation and making/cooking time at the top of the page, and the steps below the header.
