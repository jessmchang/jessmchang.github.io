Text: In the summer of 2015 I joined Alation as a product design intern for 11 weeks. I worked with two full-time designers, and three other design interns on three to four projects, from bite-sized design issues to big, challenging, design problems. At this moment I am unable to show any of my work publicly but I'd be happy to discuss more about the internship itself.
