This summer I interned at Tint as a software engineer. While many of my friends interned at large tech companies, I wanted an experience that would allow me to contribute directly to the product and the code base, and create immediate and direct impact. I wanted to solve challenging design problems and learn the best practices for creating modular and scalable web applications. 

##Analytics Dashboard

The primary feature I worked on at Tint was a new analytics dashboard. It uses Backbone.js for the primary front-end framework, d3.js to visualize data, and a few other tools such as moment.js to calculate time ranges and keen.io to measure engagement analytics. The project was a mix of design, data, and engineering â€“ three things I love. Here are a few pictures of sketches and mockups made during the ideation and implementation process:
